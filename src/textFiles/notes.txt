Notes:
The system doesn't provide the function to buy a vehicle yet,
but I will add that function after submitting this project.

When searching for a vehicle with a wear level that is a 
non-integer number (for example, 1.4) the search doesn't
work, the only way to search for that wear level is entering
the integer part of the number (for example 1), this will
find your sought number, as well as every other wear level
including that number.

Reading documentation I've learned that the default option
in a switch sentence is optional, so now I can delete the
empty default options I left inside the code xD.

I would like to add a go back function to improve the
user experience when interacting with the program.
